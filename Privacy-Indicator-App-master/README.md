## Back Story
**Recording Indicators in iOS14 :** With iOS 14, Apple is introducing a camera and microphone recording indicator in the status bar. It will appear as an orange dot above the signal bar. The **idea of a recording indicator is to alert users whenever the mic or camera are being used.** The feature will give users more control over data and privacy.

**However Android lacks such kind of privacy feature**. **Apparently, any app can use your Camera and Mic without any special notification** (once you have granted the permission). This might give a door for Malware to run a service in the background and Track everything you do Visually and Might be a threat to your privacy.

With the increase in usage of Online Platforms for Audio and Video Conferences, it's important to track which app is accessing your Camera or Microphone in the Realtime.
