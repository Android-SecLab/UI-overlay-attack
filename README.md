This repository contains the UI overlay attack Android application implemented on top of 3rd-party app 'Privacy Indicators' which has public github and MIT license.

UI overlay attack involves creating a higher z-order and deceptive status bar to hide the Android privacy indicator whenever the camera is in use, impeding recognition.
